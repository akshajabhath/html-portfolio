<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>HI I'm a Akshaja Bhat graduate engineer in computer science. Recently graduated in 2025, looking for better oppurtunities where I can showcase my skills. This html portfolio is a simple project done by me, as a part of learning course in Udemy which is "The Full Stack Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu. Before in my undergraduate year in engineering I didn't even know how to build the websites. After taking this course on Udemy now I could built a website. Thank you Angela Yu for your course in Web Development and looking forward.</p>
